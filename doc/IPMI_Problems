 1) Detection of entity presence is far too complicated.  Specifically,
    the handling of the "FRU device" detection is vague.  Does this
    mean a management controller is present or not present?  Does it
    mean that the mangement software should send a FRU inventory
    message to the FRU device and it gets an error?  If the latter is
    true, then there should be a standard 8xh return code from the FRU
    inventory saying that it is not present.

 2) The description of the LAN interface is far too vague.  Most
    systems I have seen send two messages back for one sent.  It
    doesn't say this anywhere.  A simple diagram with exactly how an
    IPMB-bridged (and system-interface bridged for that matter) works
    would make a world of difference.  IMHO, the most efficient and
    effective method would be one send and one response with the full
    response carried in the response.  Getting two messages back from
    the BMC is inefficient and confusing for every piece involved.

 3) In a type 1 SDR, byte 21 (Sensor Units 1), the data format of 11b
    means that it does not return a numeric value.  However, this means
    that you cannot interpret all the data field that come later, like
    the minimums and maximums and thresholds.  Does setting the data
    format to 11b mean that these field are not applicable?  How does
    this work?

 4) There is no reliable way to detect if the IPMI controller has
    issued an NMI due to a watchdog pretimeout.  You can't send a
    message to the IPMI controller in an NMI handler; you need a
    register that you can directly read to tell you this.  This makes
    using the NMI pretimeout very risky.

 5) In type 9 SDRs, in the entity device address fields, it states that
    it is "Set to 00h if Instace ID is device-relative".  This is
    almost certainly a mistake.  It shouldbe system-relative, not
    device-relative.

 6) There is no way to read the user session limit (set by the set user
    access command)

 7) Although IPMI supports unicode names, there doesn't seem to be a
    way to get the language that the data is in.

 8) There is no explanation of what "decide is accessed by words" means
    in the FRU inventory device commands.

 9) SNMP traps generated as defined by IPMI do not contain enough
    information to correctly identify the sensor.

10) There is no way to set the SNMP trap destination port.

11) There does not appear to be a way to clear the SEL overflow flag
    once it is set.  The operation of that flag (when set, how
    cleared) is not defined.

12) There appears to be no way to get the session limit or the enable
    value for IPMI users. 

13) There is no way to get an event to know immediately if data has
    changed (lanparm, PEF, FRU, but mostly SDRs, especially device
    SDRs).

14) There is no way to describe an entity unless it is a FRU, MC, or
    generic.  A general entity description record would be nice.

15) Manual rearm sensors are crazy.

16) The whole concept of software ids (SWIDs) is half-baked and
    probably needs to be removed.

17) There is no locking of FRU data to support multiple
    readers/writers.
