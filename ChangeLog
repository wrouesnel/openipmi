2003-03-27 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* ipmi_smi.c: Removed the timing of commands, because the
	low-level driver does it, and it introduced some race conditions.
	Specifically, if OpenIPMI timed out the command and the memory
	address got reused before the message came back in, then the
	message would be delivered to the wrong place.  It generally only
	happened when sitting for a long time in the debugger (so a whole
	slew of things happened at once).

2003-03-26 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* mc.c: Fixed some problems with non-BMC SELs.

	* ui.c: Added a log at startup to tell you to wait until startup
	is complete.

	* ui.c: Added a quit command.

2003-03-25 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* ui.c: The UI will no longer attempt to read unreadable
	controls.

2003-03-19 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* sdr.c: Modified the reservation support handling for device
	SDRs.  Start out assuming that it is supported, and if it returns
	an invalid command then assume it is not supported.  There is no
	clear way to determine if reservation is supported on device SDRs.

	* sdr.c: Check the proper MC flag if it is a sensor SDR to see if
	it supports device SDRs.

2003-03-17 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* configure.in: Updated version to 0.2.5.

2003-03-14 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* sensor.c: Yet one more cleanup for compact sensor records,
	increment the source index properly.

	* sensor.c: Removed handle_deleted_sensor() and always use
	ipmi_sensor_destroy() to clean up a sensor.

	* control.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_control.h: Added a count
	for the number of controls in a control repository.

	* sensor.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_sensor.h: Added a count
	for the number of sensors in a sensor repository.

	* mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_mc.h: Added the concept of an
	MC being active or inactive.  Active MCs are present in the
	system.  Inactive MCs are not present but referenced by SDRs, so
	they cannot be deleted.

2003-03-13 Jeff Zheng <Jeff.Zheng@Intel.com>

	* sample.c: Added a simple sample application.

2003-03-12 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* mc.c: Fixed a cleanup case in the routine that finds or creates
	an MC.

	* sensor.c: Minor sensor cleanup additions.

	* sensor.c: Fixed compact sensor records to copy the data contents
	instead of the pointer.

2003-03-06 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* configure.in: Move to version 0.2.4.

	* mc.c: Cleaned up some naming (use bmc when it is a bmc).

	* ui.c, basic_ui.c: Added a "reconnect" command to disconnect and
	reconnect to the BMC.

	* configure.in: Move to version 0.2.3.

	* mc.c: Added rescanning the entities when a connection comes
	back.

2003-03-05 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h: Fixed the description of the
	ipmi_bmc_add_con_fail_handler() call to be accurate and complete.

	* mc.c: Added starting a rescan of the IPMB bus when a connection
	comes back.

2003-02-27 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* configure.in: Move to version 0.2.2.

	* entity.c: Cleaned up entity presence detection so it works
	properly with an entity presence sensor.

	* sdr.c: Fixed a bug where the SDR fetch would go into an infinite
	loop if the last SDR was not a sensor.

	* ui.c: Fixed things so the "-c" option (not full screen) works
	ok.

2003-02-26 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* include/OpenIPMI/os_handler.h: Added thread functions and moved
	all the function OpenIPMI does not use to the end.

2003-02-25 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* configure.in: Move to version 0.2.1.

2003-02-25 Todd David <todd.c.davis@intel.com>

	* ipmi.c: Added a check for the lock actually being allocated in
	ipmi_check_lock().

2003-02-24 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* test1.c, Makefile.am: Removed this bogus file.

	* sensor.c: Handle the same sensor received multiple times from
	the same SDR.  This actually moves the sdr_sensors source array
	into the sensor itself so it can be deleted regardless of where it
	came from.

	* sdr.c: The Get Device SDR Info command is optional (even if the
	device has device SDRs, for some strange reason), so default the
	information if it's not implemented but the device supports device
	SDRs.

	* mc.c: Ignore device SDRs if we get an error back from querying
	them.

2003-02-21 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* configure.in: Moved to version 0.2.0.

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_sensor.h
	Added rearm support for sensors.
	* sensor.c: ditto
	* ui.c: ditto

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h: The spec was very confusing in
	section 29.11 and 29.14 (1.5 spec) about the event messages and
	scanning enable/disable.  After studying the spec more, I'm pretty
	sure that 1 means enabled and 0 means disabled.  I think the spec
	is saying that 0 means disabled in the way it presents this.
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_int.h: ditto
	* sensor.c: ditto
	* entity.c: ditto
	* ipmi.c: ditto
	* mc.c: ditto
	* ui.c: ditto

	* mc.c: Changed setting the event receiver for an MC to only do it
	if the event receiver was set incorrectly.

	* sel.c: Fixed a missing unlock.

	* sel.c: Modified the way individual record deletes occur and
	fetches occur to use an opq.  This way, reservations won't get
	mixed up.  Also modified individual deletes to check the value of
	the event before they actually delete it, to make 100% sure they
	are deleting the right event.

	* include/linux/ipmi.h, include/linux/ipmi_msgdefs.h: Converted to
	the new versions of the kernel headers.
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_addr.h: ditto
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_types.h: ditto
	* ipmi_smi.c: ditto

	* ipmicmd.c, Makefile.am: Added ipmicmd to this code.

2003-02-20 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* ui.c: Fixed a memory leak with controls.

	* sel.c: Make sure to report that a sel delete completed, even if
	we can only clear the whole SEL when all are done.

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_msgbits.h: Added event receiver commands.

	* mc.c: Fixed a memory leak deleting logs.

	* ui.c: Added a command to scan an IPMB address.

	* mc.c: Added code to set the event receiver for MCs to whatever
	the current event receiver device is.

	* ipmi.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_addr.h: Added a way to get the
	slave address for an address.

	* mc.c: Since the OEM code can change the values from get device
	id, the comparison code (to tell if an MC has changed) was changed
	to used a real copy of the values from the get device id, instead
	of the used values.

	* Makefile.am, ipmi.c, ipmi_malloc.c: Split off the memory
	debugging stuff into a separate file.

	* Makefile.am: Added heap.h to the file.

	* mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_oem.h: Changed the name of the
	MC removal callback to reflect it's function better (since it's
	not BMC-related).

	* entity.c: Fixed a memory leak with presence sensors.

2003-02-19 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_conn.h: Modified the ipmi_init_con()
	call to take the slave address.
	
	* ipmi_lan.c, ipmi_smi.c: Now pass in the slave address to
	ipmi_init_con().

	* OpenIPMI.texi: Updated docs for changes.

	* ui.c: Various cleanups for the SMI address and the new SEL
	setup.
	
	* ilist.c, ilist.h: Added a way to traverse the list backwards.

	* ipmi_smi.c: Converted the BMC to use an SMI address.

	* mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_mc.h: Added a way for the OEM code
	to add a way to fetch the SMI slave address.

	* mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_mc.h, sel.c:
	Changed SEL support to be per-MC (as it should be) and not on the
	BMC.  This will allow support for SELs not on the MC, and for
	multiple SEL devices in a system.  It required the removal of
	ipmi_bmc_del_event_by_recid(), and a modification to the event
	structure, since the system now has to know what MC the event came
	from.

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_types.h: Added an MC to the event so we
	know which MC it came from.

2003-02-18 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* ui.c: Added a way to set the event enables.

	* sdr.c: Made some of the err info logs unique.

	* mc.c, entity.c: memory leak removals
	
	* ilist.c, ilist.h, ipmi.c: Added separate allocation routines
	for the ilist code.
	
	* mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_oem.h: Added a shutdown callback to
	the OEM registeration.

	* mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_mc.h: Added global shutdown code for
	the mc.

	* ipmi.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h: Added global shutdown code.
	
	* ipmi.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_int.h: Added memory debugging
	code.
	
	* basic_ui.c: Converted over to the new memory debugging code.
	* control.c: ditto
	* entity.c: ditto
	* ipmi.c: ditto
	* ipmi_lan.c: ditto
	* ipmi_smi.c: ditto
	* mc.c: ditto
	* md2.c: ditto
	* md5.c: ditto
	* opq.c: ditto
	* sdr.c: ditto
	* sel.c: ditto
	* selector.c: ditto
	* sensor.c: ditto
	* ui.c: ditto
	* ui_command.c: ditto
	* ui_keypad.c: ditto
	* ui_os.c: ditto

	* selector.c, heap.h: Split out the heap code into a generic.

	* test_btree.c: Added a test for the heap code.

2003-02-13 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* configure.in: Moved to version 0.1.4.

2003-02-12 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	that comparisons work properly.
	
2003-02-09 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* configure.in: Moved to version 0.1.3.

	* Makefile.am: Fixed include of "include" dir to be based on
	srcdir, removed -Werror.

	* src.c, selector.c, sel.c, ui.c: Fixed some deprecated
	operations to avoid warnings in gcc3.x.

2003-02-03 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h, sel.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_sel.h:
	Modified the previous change to report the number of entries in
	the SEL, since the number of total entries available in the SEL
	may not be available.
	
	* mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h, sel.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_sel.h:
	Added a way to get the estimated number of entries left for new
	events in the SEL.

2003-01-30 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* configure.in: Move to version 0.1.2.

	* mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h: Added a mechanism for changing
	the SEL rescan timers and the bus rescan timers.

	* entity.c: Lots of little cleanup for parent-child relationships
	and shutdown.

	* sensor.c: Lots of little cleanups for handling new SDRs.

	* ui.c: Fixed some problems with threshold display, and added
	the current value of the threshold (out of range).

	* sensor.c: Fixed problems with sensor allocation.

2003-01-24 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* ui.c: Changed shutdown code to close the connection first.
	
	* mc.c: Modified the close connection code to avoid locking
	problems.

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h: Changed the format of the close done
	callback to remove the BMC (since it will be gone).
	
	* selector.c, include/OpenIPMI/selector.h: Modified the selector
	code to be reentrant
	
	* ipmi.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_int.h: Added a way to allocate a
	lock using the global IPMI selector.

	* basic_ui.c, test1.c: Changed to account for the selector
	changes.

2003-01-22 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* basic_ui.c, ui.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_ui.h: Start working on a
	command-line only version of the ui.

	* ui.c: Rework to abstract the output, getting ready for doing
	command-line only.

	* mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_mc.h: Added support for setting more
	device support bits.

	* ui.c: Added a command to dump the SDRs.
	
	* sdr.c: Reworked the fetching of SDRs to get the SDR info first,
	then to do the reservation if it is required.

	* sensor.c: Fixed the sensor calculation values to be the right
	signedness.
	
	* mc.c: Modified SEL fetch to restart the timer after the previous
	SEL fetch completes.

	* configure.in: Went to version 0.1.1

2003-01-20 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* ui.c: Added a list_sel command.

	* ui.c: Modified the clear sel command to go through all the
	events and delete them, instead of clearing the SEL with a
	command.

	* sel.c: Fixed the next, previous, first, last, and get all
	operations to take into account deleted events.  Also fixed a bug
	where re-adding an event that was deleted would cause the count to
	be wrong.

2003-01-17 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* ui.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_int.h: Added a debug flag to disable
	LAN connections.

	* mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_conn.h:
	Added a mechanism to report failures of the lower-level
	connection, and added code to ignore periodic events (bus scan,
	SEL scan) while the connection is down.
	* ipmi_lan.c: ditto
	* ipmi_smi.c: ditto
	
	* OpenIPMI.texi: Documented the changes to the SEL code.
	
	* mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_oem.h: Added an OEM callback for MC
	removal.

	* mc.c: Added detection of when an MC goes away or changes.

	the entities and sensors are gone, and the entity was
	auto-created, that the entity itself would be destroyed.

	* sel.c: Reworked the event deletion code so that it works even
	without the ability to delete individual entries.  If all the
	entries in the local database are deleted, it will clear out the
	database (if the reservation hasn't been lost).

2003-01-15 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* sel.c: Fixed a locking problem with SEL operations.
	
	* mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_mc.h: Added a hook for event
	deletion handling, so OEM code can do its own event deletion.

	* mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_mc.h: Added handling for ignoring
	events (only sending to the unhandled interface) for events that
	were already in the SEL at startup.

2003-01-14 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* ui.c: Added a fix for handling local interface BMCs.

	* OpenIPMI.texi: More work on docs.
	
	* sel.c, mc.c: Minor cleanups.

	* ipmi_smi.c: Modified the timeout to be a much larger value.
	The device drivers have their own timers, we just need to make
	sure something doesn't go wrong here.

2003-01-09 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* mc.c: Added a periodic rescan of the presence sensors
	periodically (with the bus scan).
	
	* ui.c: Added rescanning of entities when displaying them.
	
	* mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/mc.h, entity.c: Added support for
	handling unhandled (not delivered to the user) events, so the user
	can delete them if they like.

	* ui.c: The info wasn't being passed into the id-to-pointer
	converted for the mccmd command.
	
	* OpenIPMI.texi: More work on docs.

	* control.c: Fixed the calculation size for the non-standard entry
	array size.

2003-01-09 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* OpenIPMI.texi: More work on docs.
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_control.h: ditto
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_sensor.h: ditto
