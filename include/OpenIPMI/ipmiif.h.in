/*
 * This is the main include file for dealing with IPMI.  It provides
 * an abstract interface to the IPMI system, so you don't have to deal
 * with all the nitty-gritty details of IPMI.  You only deal with
 * four things:
 *
 *  Domain - This is the main interface to the IPMI system.
 *  Entities - These are things that sensors monitor, they can be
 *             FRUs, or whatnot.
 *  Sensors - These are monitors for FRUs.
 *  Controls - These are output devices
 *
 * You don't have to deal with Management Controllers (MCs), IPMI
 * addressing, or anything like that.  This software will go out onto
 * the IPMB bus, detect all the MCs and entities present there, and
 * call you when it detects something.  It reads the SDR database and
 * detects all the entities and entity relationships.  It lets you add
 * entities and relationships to the local copies, and write the
 * information back into the database.
 *
 * You have to be careful with locking in this system.  The four things
 * you deal with all have two ways to get at them: An ID, and a pointer.
 * The ID is always valid, you can store that off on your own and use it
 * later.  The pointer is only valid inside a callback, the system is
 * free to change the pointers for a thing when no callbacks are active.
 *
 * To convert an ID to a pointer that you can work on, you have to go
 * through a callback.  These are provided for each type.  This is a
 * little inconvenient, but it's a lot faster than copying a lot of
 * data around all the time or re-validating an ID on every operation.
 * If a callback gives you a pointer to a sensor, entity, or domain, the
 * lock for that things will be held while you are in the callback.
 *
 * This interface is completely event-driven, meaning that a call will
 * never block.  Instead, if a call cannot complete inside the call
 * itself, you provide a "callback" that will be called when the
 * operation completes.  If you don't care about the results, you can
 * provide a NULL callback.  However, you will not receive any error
 * information about the operation; if it fails you will not know.
 * Note that if a function that you provide a callback returns an
 * error, the callback will NEVER be called.
 *
 * Callbacks are possible on things that have ceased to exist.  For
 * example, if you start an operation on a sensor and the sensor
 * ceases to exist during the operation, you will get an error
 * callback with a NULL sensor.  The same goes for controls, entities,
 * or anything else.
 *
 * You should NEVER block or exit in a callback.  Locks are held in
 * callbacks, so you will constipate the system if you block in
 * callbacks.  Just don't do it.

/* This is how you convert a pointer to and ID and convert an ID to a
   pointer.  Pointers are ONLY valid in callbacks, the system is free
   to change the pointer value outside the callback.  So you should
   only store IDs.  IDs are good all the time, but you must go through
   the "pointer_cb" functions to get a usable pointer you can operate
   on.  This is how the locking works for this, inside the callback
   you will hold the locks so the item you are using will not change.
   It's kind of a pain, but it improves reliability.  This way, you
   cannot "forget" to release the lock for something.  Note that this
   callback function you provide will be called immediately in the
   same thread of execution, this callback is not delayed or spawned
   off to another thread. */
