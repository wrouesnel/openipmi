.TH ipmi_ui 1 05/13/03 OpenIPMI "Crude interface to an IPMI system"

.SH NAME
ipmi_ui \- Crude interface to an IPMI system

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ipmiui
[\-dmsg] [\-dmem] [\-c] <connection 1> [<connection 2>]

The connections are specified as either:

smi <smi num>

or

lan <IP addr> <port> [<IP addr 2> <port 2>] <auth> <privilege> <username> <password>

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR ipmi_ui
program connects to an IPMI system, and allows access to IPMI entities
and sensors and OpenIPMI controls.  It's rather crude, and primarily
for testing OpenIPMI, but it has some use beyond that so it is
provided.

Normally,
.BR ipmi_ui
starts up in a full-screen format.  The left window shows the output
of commands, the right window shows the logs from OpenIPMI.  Both
windows are scrollable with page up and page down keys, press the "F1"
key to choose the the left window to scroll, the "F2" key to choose
the right window to scroll.

Note that you must set your environment TERM variable properly for
your terminal, or ipmi_ui will display garbage on the screen.

Note that you can put two connection specifications on the command
line, and ipmi_ui will make two connection.  You can only do this if
the connections are to the same IPMI domain through different
management controllers.  Also, each LAN connection may have two IP
addresses.  These are two different addresses to the same management
controller.  So you may have a total of 4 IP addresses to an IPMI
domain, two management controllers and two IP adresses to each
management controller.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I "\-dmsg"
Turn on message debugging, this will dump all messages to the log window.
.TP
.I "\-dmem"
Turn on memory debugging, this will cause memory allocation and
deallocations to be checked.  When the program terminates, it will
dump all memory that was not properly freed (leaked).
.TP
.I "\-snmp"
Enable the SNMP trap handler.  ipmi_ui must be compiled with SNMP code
enabled for this option to be available.
.TP
.I \-c
Run the program in command-line mode.  This is useful for scripting.
All output goes to standard output, there is no windowing.

.TP
.I "smi num"
The SMI number to connect to, for systems with more than on system
interface.  Generally, this is '0'.

.TP
.I "IP addr"
The IP address of the LAN interface.

.TP
.I "port"
The UDP port of the LAN interface, general 623.

.TP
.I "IP addr 2"
Some systems support multiple IP connections, this specified the
second address and is optional.  If specified, OpenIPMI will use both
IP addresses and fail over to the working one if one of them fails.

.TP
.I "port 2"
The port for the second IP connection, generally 623.

.TP
.I "auth"
The authorization to use for the connection, either "none",
"straight", "md5", or "md2".

.TP
.I "privilege"
The privilege to use for the connection, either "callback", "user",
"operator", or "admin".  Note that some IPMI operations will fail
without the correct privilege.

.TP
.I "username"
The user name to use for the connection.  If using this anonymous
user, this should be the empty string "".

.TP
.I "password"
The password to use for the connection.

.SH ENTITIES

Entities are listed by their entity id (the type of entity they are)
and their entity instance.  Entities may be active or inactive in the
system, the standard IPMI algorithm for determining this is used.
Commands on entities are:

.SS entities
List all the entities in the system.  The output is the entity
specifier, followed by an optional entity name in parenthesis,
followed by "present" or "not present".

.SS check_presence
For the check of presence for all entities.

.SS fru <entity>
List the FRU information associated with the entity.

.SS dump_fru <is_logical> <device_address> <device_id> <lun> <private_bus> <channel>
Dump raw information from the specified FRU device.

.SH SENSORS

Sensors define input devices that OpenIPMI can monitor.

.SS sensors <entity>

List all the sensors that monitor the given entity.  The output is the
sensor specifier (the entity specifier followed by the sensor name,
with spaces converted to ~). followed by the sensor name.

.SS sensor <sensor>

Pull up the given sensor and display all its information.  In
full-screen mode, the sensor will be re-queried every second.

.SS rearm <global> [<assertion mask> <deassertion mask>]

Rearm the given sensor.  If
.I "global"
is 1, then the whole sensor is rearmed.  If
.I "global"
is 0, then the
.I "assertion mask"
and
.I "deassertion mask"
must be specified telling which thresholds or states to rearm.

.SS events_enable <events> <scanning> <assertion bitmask> <deassertion bitmask>

Enable or disable events for the given sensor.
.I "events"
turns events on or off from the sensor (0 or 1).
.I "scanning"
turns scanning on or off for the sensor (0 or 1).
.I "assertion bitmask" specifies the bitmask of thresholds or states
that should be enabled or disabled when a thrshold or state is
asserted.  It is a bunch of 0's and 1's, where the first one is for
threshold/state 0, the second for threshold/state 1, etc.
.I "deassertion bitmask" specifies the bitmask of thresholds or states
that should be enabled or disabled when a thrshold or state is
deasserted.

.SH CONTROLS

Controls are output devices that can control things like LEDs, power,
reset lines and such.

.SS controls <entity>

List all the controls that control the given entity.  The output is
the control specifier (the entity specifier followed by the control
name, with spaces converted to ~). followed by the control name.

.SS control <control>

Pull up the given control and display it's current state.

.SS set_control <val1> [<val2> ...]

Change the value of a control.  Note that for controls with multiple
values,
.B every
value must be specified.


.SH EVENTS

Events are asynchronous messages from sensors that tell the user that
a sensor has done something.  Events are generally stored in a system
event log (SEL); OpenIPMI will fetch the events from the SELs in the
system.

Since multiple SELs may exist, an event is specified by the MC it came
from in the format "(channel addr)" and a log number.  The same log
number may exist in multiple MCs.

Events are displayed in the log window as they come in.  If they can
be correlated with a sensor, they will be display with as much
information as possible.

.SS delevent <channel> <mc addr> <log num>

Delete the given event.  Note that many SELs do not support individual
deletes, so this may only delete the local copy of the event, not the
one in the SEL.  In this case, to delete events in the SEL, you must
delete
.B all
the events in the SEL and wait about 10 seconds for OpenIPMI to do a
full SEL clear.

.SS clear_sel

Delete all events in the SEL.  This process may take some time, so
if you do this and quit immediately it may not be complete.

.SS list_sel

List all events in the local copy of the SELs.  This is only the local
copy, if the copies in the actual have change, this won't be reflected.

.SS get_sel_time <channel> <mc num>
Get the time in the SEL for the given MC.


.SH MANAGMENT CONTROLLERS (MCs)

In OpenIPMI, you normally don't deal with management controllers.
They are considered internal to the system.  However, for debugging,
information about them is provided.

.SS mcs

List all the MCs in the system and whether they are active.  MCs are
displayed in the format "(channel address)".

.SS mc <channel> <mc addr>

Display a boatload of information about the MC, mostly coming from the
get device id command.

.SS mccmd <channel> <mc addr> <LUN> <NetFN> <Cmd> [<data> ...]

Send an IPMI command to the given MC.  The MC must exist and be active
to do this.

.SS mc_reset <channel> <mc addr> [warm | cold]
Send a warm or cold reset command to the given MC.  The action the MC
takes is system-specific.

.SS scan <channel> <mc addr>
Scan for an MC at the given address.  If the MC exists but OpenIPMI
didn't know about it, it will be added.  If the MC no longer exists,
then it will be removed.

.SS mc_events_enable <channel> <mc num> <enabled>
Enable or disable event generation for the given MC.

.SS mc_events_enabled <channel> <mc num>
Prints out if the events are enabled for the given MC.


.SH LAN Parameter Configuration

OpenIPMI has functions that make it easier to configure the LAN
parameters of a LAN connection.  Note that the LAN parameters have a
lock that OpenIPMI attempts to use.  If you read the LAN parameters,
they will be locked until you either write them or clear the lock.

.SS readlanparm <channel> <mc num> <channel>
Read lanparm information from an MC and display it in the display window.

.SS viewlanparm
Show current lanparm information in the display window.

.SS writelanparm <channel> <mc num> <channel>
Write the current LANPARM information to an MC.  Note that this must be
the MC that the parameters were read from.

.SS clearlanparmlock [<channel> <mc num> <channel>]
Clear a LANPARM lock.  If the MC is given, then the LANPARM lock is
directly cleared.  If not given, then the LANPARM lock for the current
parms is cleared.

.SS setlanparm <config> [<selector>] <value>
Set the given config item to the value.  The optional selector is used
for items that take a selector, like "auth" or any of the items in
"destination".

.SH Platform Event Filter (PEF)

OpenIPMI contains function to help manage the PEF settings on a BMC.
Note that the PEF parameters have a lock that OpenIPMI attempts to
use.  If you read the PEF parameters, they will be locked until you
either write them or clear the lock.

.SS readpef <channel> <mc num>
Read the PEF information from an MC.

.SS clearpeflock [<channel> <mc num>]
Clear a PEF lock.  If the MC is given, then the PEF lock on that MC is
directly cleared.  If no MC is given, then the current PEF's lock is
cleared.

.SS viewpef
Show current pef information in the display window.

.SS writepef <channel> <mc num>
Write the current PEF information to an MC.

.SS setpef <config> [<selector>] <value>
Set the given config item to the value.  The optional selector is used
for items that take a selector, like anything in the event filters,
alert policies, or alert strings.

.SS pet <connection> <channel> <ip addr> <mac_addr> <eft selector> <policy num> <apt selector> <lan dest selector>
Set up the connection for the domain to send PET traps from the given
connection to the given IP/MAC address over the given channel.  This
does all the LAN and PEF configuration required to configure a system
to send event traps.


.SH CONNECTIONS

OpenIPMI can maintain multiple connections to a single domain.  It
will generally only use one of these at a time (although the other
will constantly be under test).  This is the "active" connection.  You
can query and set which connection is active.

The connection number is the connection from the command line.  You
can specify two connections on the command line (the part beginning
with "lan", "smi", etc.).  The first connection you specify is
connection zero, the second is connection 1.

.SS is_con_active <connection>
Print out if the given connection is active or not.

.SS activate_con <connection>
Activate the given connection.


.SH OTHER COMMANDS

.SS msg <channel> <IPMB addr> <LUN> <NetFN> <Cmd> [<data> ...]

Send an IPMI command to the given IPMB address.  This is available in
case the given MC cannot be found or enabled.

.SS sdrs <channel> <mc addr> <do sensors>

Dump all the sdrs from the given MC.  If
.I "do sensors"
is true, then dump the device SDR.  If it is false, dump the main SDR
repository on the MC.

.SS scan <channel> <IPMB addr>

Perform an IPMB bus scan for the given IPMB, to try to detect an MC at
the given address.  IPMB bus scanning can be slow, this can help speed
things up if you already know the address.

.SS quit

Leave the program.

.SS reconnect

Attempt to disconnect and reconnect to the IPMI controller.  This is
primarily for testing.

.SS display_win

Set the display window (left window) for scrolling, just in case the
"F1" key doesn't work.

.SS log_win

Set the log window (right window) for scrolling, just in case the "F2"
key doesn't work.

.SS help

Dump some terse help output about all the commands.


.SH "ERROR OUTPUT"
All error output goes to the log window.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
